## Founders

We are looking for people to help start the coop and become the founders. We need at least 5 people from the Northern Melbourne suburbs who are willing to be involved to found this innovative idea. You will be involved in the creation of the coop, attend workshops and ultimately decide on the legal framework of the coop itself.

As part of incubator.coop we will create [treaties](https://www.incubator.coop/create-a-treaty/) between the founders and the coop.
