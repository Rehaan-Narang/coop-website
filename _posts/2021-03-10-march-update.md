### Loconomics Update March 2021
Loconomics is a new Darebin not-for-profit, developing an ethical website to support sole traders and other self-employed people, in the recovery from COVID 19. Loconomics will enable locals to find local quality professionals, and sole traders to find local customers and ongoing work. The hoped outcome is a stronger community both with stronger connections and stronger economy.
Loconomics would love input from our resourceful Darebin community. We know from the active online communities, that Darebin-ites often look for recommendations of local, high quality professionals to help with various tasks. We also know that there is a lot of talented and professional workers in Darebin. And we want to bring you together.
Please share with us your experiences and opinions. You will be reimbursed for your time. Each survey completed has the chance to go into the draw to win a $100 voucher from a local Darebin business. Each chat will be given a voucher for a local Darebin Business.
