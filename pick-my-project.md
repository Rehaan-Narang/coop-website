### Loconomicsâ€™ mission is to use technology, shared ownership, and community to grow local economies.
We provide NorthMetro service professionals (owners) with the tools, marketplace, and community that empower them to thrive in their work, whilst protecting their rights as workers.
Together, we are building an on-demand marketplace where everyone can discover and book local service professionals safely, easily, and directly.
We wish to empower our local NorthMetro communities to find talented and available local professionals who can provide a tailored service to meet demand.

This pilot project will globalise an existing platform and allow us to promote our local communities.

### Loconomics will empower service providers in the NorthMetro Region with an alternative to exploitative gig economies. 

In Darebin: between 2015-16, sole traders in Transport, postal and warehousing increased 19%; 66% of businesses are sole traders. Research shows adoption of digital platforms is estimated to add 1.9% to GDP and 271,000 jobs by 2025.
Currently participants in the gig economies have no control over their working conditions, and current platforms offer no control over how the platform works. The value of the service is extracted by the platform, leaving service providers out of pocket.
