## Call to suspend the current tier pricing system during Stage 4 Restrictions in Melbourne

Victoria is currently experiencing a disaster due to COVID 19. The Victorian Government has shut down almost all economic activity in Greater Melbourne to control the spread of the Coronavirus. Many workers are no longer able to work at this time. This includes gig economy workers who are already some of the most precarious workers in our community. 

Currently, Airtasker workers are incentivised to continue working to gain their gold or silver tasker ratings.  If they are unable to work on the platform during Stage 4 Restrictions, they will lose their ratings, in turn affecting their ability to gain work in the future and the amount of fees that they pay.

We call on Airtasker to suspend the current tier pricing system for all workers in Greater Melbourne during Stage 4 Restrictions. 

We all need to work together to keep our community safe from this terrible virus.

Stay Safe,
