## Curbside Carnies

Welcome to a brand new contactless circus experience, Curbside Carnies! Devised by Reservoir local, Sophie deLightful, during lockdown, this nifty new project will feature a handpicked selection of local circus performers who are absolutely itching to get back onto a real stage and perform to live audiences. 


The Curbside Carnies project features a custom-built roving stage that will be pulled around the suburbs of Melbourne, stopping at pre-determined locations to perform circus shows throughout the day. Each show will feature a variety of circus skills, from hula hooping, juggling and singing, to clowning, unicycle or fire performance! Suitable for kids of all ages :) 


The first outing for Curbside Carnies will be Reservoir! Presented by local services cooperative Loconomics, it is planned for early October and, thanks to the support of the Inner North Foundation, will be absolutely FREE to attend. Of course, as is street-performing tradition, we will have a hat out in case the kids want to throw some change our way. Every little bit helps to pay our performers and maintain our stage and props.
