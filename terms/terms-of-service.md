## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Loconomics.

These Terms of Service (“Agreement”) contain the terms on which Loconomics Australia, Inc. (“Loconomics” or “Loconomics Cooperative”), a California Consumer Cooperative Corporation, offers you access to [www.loconomics.com.au](http://www.loconomics.com.au/), an internet platform (”Website") and mobile application (“Loconomics Application”). Loconomics Australia owns and operates this Website, the Loconomics Application, the mobile and touch versions of the Website, and any individual websites or service-professional-specific, city-specific, or other area-specific websites we have now or in the future. The Loconomics Application, the Website, and links contained within or otherwise available through external hyperlinks within or directed to our Website or the Loconomics Application, and various services provided by Loconomics or third parties will be collectively referred to as the “Loconomics Service.”

By using the Loconomics Service, you agree to this Agreement with Loconomics. It is important that you understand the Agreement, because the Agreement governs your relationship with Loconomics as well as transactions made with third parties using Loconomics.

This Agreement includes:

-   a) Your agreement that the Loconomics Service is provided “as is” and without warranty (Section 21).
    
-   b) Your agreement that Loconomics has no liability regarding the Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service (Section 20).
    
-   c) Your consent to release Loconomics from liability based on claims between Users (Section 17).
    
-   d) Your agreement to indemnify Loconomics from claims due to your use or inability to use the Loconomics Service or content submitted to the Loconomics Service in connection with your account or profile (Section 22).
    
-   e) Your consent that either party has the right to compel arbitration (Section 18).
    
-   f) Your consent that no claims can be adjudicated on a class basis (Section 18).
    

This Agreement is effective on October 1st, 2017 for current users, and upon acceptance for new users.

## 2. Use of the Loconomics Service

Before you may become a User of the Loconomics Service, you must read and accept all of the terms of this Agreement, the Loconomics [Privacy Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/privacy-policy), the Loconomics [Background Check and License Verification Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/background-check-policy), and other policies currently published on the Website. You agree that this Agreement, the [Privacy Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/privacy-policy), the [Background Check and License Verification Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/background-check-policy), and other published policies on the Website will apply whenever you use the Loconomics Service.

You are responsible for all equipment required to access the Loconomics Service, including but not limited to, a properly-configured computer or smartphone with Internet access, any required software such as a properly-configured Internet browser or mobile application, and any other equipment needed to use the Loconomics Service.

Only persons who are 18 years old or older may become a User of the Loconomics Service. This is because persons who are under 18 years old are unable to enter into binding contracts.

You may not interfere with the proper working of the Loconomics Service. You may not copy, modify, or distribute (a) content from the Loconomics Service or (b) any other content covered by Loconomics' copyrights and trademarks. You may not harvest or otherwise collect information about Users, including email addresses, without those Users' consent.

Your User Account may be terminated without warning if Loconomics believes that you have violated any term of this Agreement or any federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.

## 3. Neutral Venue

The Loconomics Service is a communications and client management platform for connecting people offering Services (“Service Professionals”) and people looking for Services (“Clients”). Service Professionals, Website visitors, Clients, and other users of the Loconomics Service together are referred to as "Users." The work that a Service Professional will provide to a Client, and for which the Client will pay the Service Professional, is referred to as “Services.” Services also include any materials provided by the Service Professional, either with or without charge, to the Client. Loconomics creates a neutral venue for Service Professionals to find Clients, and for Clients to find Service Professionals.

Users contract for Services directly with other Users. Loconomics does not take part in the Services provided to Clients by Service Professionals and will not be a party to any contracts for Services. Rather, Loconomics is merely a communication, scheduling, and payment processing platform.

When using the Loconomics Service, you may be a Service Professional, a Client, or both.

Users do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether written or oral, implied or express, on behalf of Loconomics.

## 4. No Employment of Service Professionals

Loconomics is not an employer of the Service Professionals and Service Professionals do not become Loconomics employees by providing Services to Clients or by becoming Owners of Loconomics. You acknowledge that we do not supervise, direct, control, or make representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Services offered and provided by Service Professionals through the Loconomics Service in any manner. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by the receipt of any benefits or advantages received by Service Professionals through Loconomics. As such, we will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social security, or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Loconomics Service. You understand and agree that if we are found to be liable for any tax or tax withholding in connection with your use of Services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold harmless, reimburse (for taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees), and defend us from any and all claims that a Service Professional was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee, any claims that we were an employer or joint employer of a Service Professional, and any claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wage and hour laws, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.

Service Professionals are solely responsible for all aspects of the Services they perform, including the quality, timing, legality, or failure to provide Services. Loconomics does not control the actions or inactions of Users.

Loconomics does not provide any materials or supplies to provide the Services. Service Professionals must provide their own tools and equipment.

Service Professionals manage their own schedules, availability, pricing, and quality of Services provided.

Loconomics does not require training for Service Professionals, apart from training that the Service Professional must obtain for providing Licensed Professional Services. However, optional training may be offered as a benefit for Loconomics Owners.

Service Professionals are encouraged to advertise independently.

One purpose of forming Loconomics as a cooperative is to provide ideal working opportunities and conditions to independent Service Professionals, while ensuring that Services Professionals remain independent and have choice and flexibility in their work.

## 5. User Accounts and Communication

If you are a Client, you must create a User Account with Loconomics to schedule an appointment. If you are a Service Professional, you must create a User Account with Loconomics to use the Loconomics Service. If you create a User Account with us, you agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information and to update such data as necessary. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that your information is inaccurate, we may suspend or terminate your account and prohibit you from any use of the Loconomics Service (see also Section 14, “Loconomics Service Termination”). You agree not to use any user name that is obscene, defamatory, or derogatory. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for changing your password if you believe that it has been stolen or might otherwise be misused. You agree to notify Loconomics immediately of any unauthorized use of your user name and/or password and any other suspected breach of security regarding the Loconomics Service. We shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized use of your user name and/or password.

Any personally identifiable information supplied will be subject to the terms of the [Privacy Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/privacy-policy).

By providing your phone number and using the Loconomics Service, you hereby affirmatively consent to Loconomics and Users conducting transactions with each other through the Loconomics Service using your phone number for calls and, if such phone number is a mobile number, for text messages, in order to assist with facilitating the requested Services. Standard call or message charges or other charges from your phone carrier may apply to calls or text messages we send you. You may opt-out of receiving text messages from Loconomics by replying with the word "STOP" to a text message from Loconomics.

Loconomics may send you confirmation and other transactional emails regarding the Services. Loconomics may also send you emails about services that we think might interest you (“Promotional Emails”). The Promotional Emails include an option for you to opt out of receiving such emails.

## 6. Rules for Service Professionals

Service Professionals must be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies; however, worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations may be Service Professionals if approved as Owners according to the Bylaws and any other policies specifically applicable to worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations. Except in the case of worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations, the profile you create must represent a single person performing Services; you may not have employees, agents, or substitutes provide Services on your behalf.

Service Professionals may choose to partner with other Service Professionals using our group scheduling functionality to perform particular Services that require more than one person. In such cases, Service Professionals must still be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies.

Service Professionals must perform Services at the scheduled time and as described to the Client when scheduling or, if you are unable to fulfill Services at the scheduled time, you must promptly notify the Client and cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.

Service Professionals are responsible for managing availability for online appointments including maintaining the accuracy and completeness of available times, Services available, service locations and/or service areas, and all other information necessary for Clients to schedule online appointments with you.

Service Professionals offering mental and health care Services that are reimbursable by federal and state health care programs agree:

-   a) not to seek reimbursement from any third party payer (including, but not limited to, Medicare or Medi-Cal) for any portion, in whole or in part, of the Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, and to accept as payment in full the amount paid by Client for the Services at the time of scheduling (or later, if so agreed);
    
-   b) not to offer Services at discounted or promotional pricing through the Loconomics Service, and not to advertise any such discounts or promotions through the Loconomics Service.
    

The Services cannot, under any circumstances, include:

-   a) sexual activity; or
    
-   b) unlawful activity of any kind.
    

It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally able to provide your Services.

You represent that you have the legal ability in your jurisdiction and where you are marketing your Services to perform the Services listed in the Loconomics Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent that you have any license required to provide your Services and are willing to undergo a Background Check prior to providing Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services (see also Section 19, “Background Checks”).

## 7. Rules for Clients

Clients are solely responsible for choosing suitable Service Professionals. Loconomics does not endorse any Service Professional. When acting as a Client, you agree that Loconomics is not responsible or liable for unsatisfactory Services performed by Service Professionals. You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary or appropriate before hiring or engaging a Service Professional (see also Section 19, “Background Checks”).

Clients are responsible for attending (if so agreed at the time of scheduling) all appointments made through the Loconomics Service or, if you are unable to attend an appointment, to promptly notify the Service Professional and cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.

You may not hire Service Professionals with the purpose of reselling their Services.

You will take the necessary safety precautions when meeting Service Professionals to ensure both their and your own safety.

You accept responsibility to confirm that the Service Professional's identity and professional license or certification (if required) match the information on their profile.

## 8. Fee Structure

Joining Loconomics, viewing profiles, and viewing descriptions of Services are free. Current fees for all services are listed on our [Fees page](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/fees). The following provides a general overview of fee structure and which specific fee amounts are subject to change.

If you are a Service Professional, you may use the Loconomics Service free of charge for a limited time per any promotional terms (“Trial Period”). After the Trial Period has ended, payment of a monthly or annual fee “User Fee” is required to continue using the Loconomics Service. A valid credit card is required, and the User Fee is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis (“Billing Period”) in accordance with our pricing schedule. Payment for the first Billing Period of service will become due immediately upon the end of the Trial Period; if you have not yet entered your credit card information, we will prompt you for this information. You must enter your credit card information before the end of the Trial Period or your account will become inaccessible. After your credit card information is entered, your credit card will be immediately charged for the first Billing Period of service. Thereafter, your credit card will be billed for each Billing Period after the Trial Period until your account is terminated by you or by Loconomics. You warrant that the credit card you enter is good and valid, and that you are authorized to use such credit card. You authorize Loconomics to charge such credit card for amounts due for the Loconomics Service. Loconomics reserves the right to suspend or cancel your account if a charge to your credit card is denied or disputed. All payments are non-refundable; Loconomics does not refund for partial months of service or non-use of the Loconomics Service. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities with respect to your use of the Loconomics Service, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

Loconomics may charge a fee to Clients upon scheduling of Services through the Loconomics Service. Any “Booking Fee” will be disclosed at the time the scheduling is made.

Loconomics intentionally does not charge any Booking Fee for any mental or health care Services regulated under federal or state law prohibiting such fees. Should you feel a Booking Fee has been charged in error for such Services, please e-mail support@@loconomics.com.au and it will be refunded and corrected.

Loconomics charges a set fee for certain premium services, such as a Background Check. The cost of a premium service is disclosed at the time you sign up for the premium service.

Loconomics deducts the Payment Service Provider's payment processing fees from the total amount paid by a Client for Services before transferring the Payment Amount owed to a Service Professional.

Loconomics reserves the right to change the fee structure set forth above, at its sole discretion. Loconomics will give Users at least fourteen (14) calendar days' notice of any change to the fee structure by posting the change on the Loconomics Service.

## 9. Payments, Adjustments, and Cancellations

Users of the Loconomics Service may be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Loconomics and the Payment Service Provider “PSP” retained by Loconomics (currently, Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.).

The cost of Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, any agreed out of pocket expenses owed to the Service Professional, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and any service fees owed to Loconomics for the use of the Loconomics Service are collectively referred to as the “Payment Amount.”

When payment is required when scheduling Services, Loconomics will charge the Client's credit card the Payment Amount after the appointment for the scheduled Services. Loconomics may also put a hold on the Client's credit card for the Payment Amount at the time the appointment is scheduled through the Loconomics Service to ensure that payment can be taken at the appropriate time. Certain Services may require that, by a clearly stated deadline, a Client and/or Service Professional mark that Services are complete after the appointment is finished and/or finalize a Payment Amount. Should the User not complete the requested actions before the deadline, the User forfeits their right to make any adjustments.

When payment is not required at the time of scheduling an appointment, the Client agrees to pay the Service Professional the Payment Amount using the Service Professional's preferred payment option(s).

Service Professionals may make bundles or packages available in which Users can purchase multiple Services or sessions in a single transaction. All sessions of the Services must be scheduled through the Loconomics Service. Service Professionals may set an expiration date for any bundle or package, and any unused package value is lost as of the expiration date.

Clients may have the option of choosing that the Services to be repeated on a regular basis (“Recurrent Services”). For example, a Client may choose that Services be performed every two weeks. When a Client chooses Recurrent Services, Loconomics will automatically schedule those Recurrent Services to occur on future dates indefinitely at the frequency requested by the Client. The Client's credit card will be charged for the Recurrent Services as the appointments for Services occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Loconomics cannot guarantee appointments for Recurrent Services will not be canceled or rescheduled by the Service Professional.

Services may be canceled or rescheduled up to the "Cancellation Period" (the advance notice prior to the scheduled appointment time required to effect an appointment cancellation outlined in the Service Professional's own policy on cancellation (“Cancellation Policy”) of the appointment to take place. If you wish to cancel or reschedule Services, you must do so by using the appointment cancellation feature through the Loconomics Service prior to any Cancellation Period for such Services. You understand and agree that should you cancel or reschedule your Services after the Cancellation Period or if you do not show up for your appointment time, you may be charged part of or the full value of the Services in accordance with the Service Professional's Cancellation Policy (“Cancellation Fee”).

Service Professionals set their own Cancellation Policies, and Loconomics must enforce these Cancellation Policies. It is therefore very important to understand a Service Professional's Cancellation Policy prior to attempting to cancel or reschedule an appointment. A full refund of a Cancellation Fee may be issued to a Client upon three events:

-   a) if the Client cancels Services before the Cancellation Period;
    
-   b) if the Service Professional cancels the Client Services; or
    
-   c) if the Service Professional refuses to honor any Services at the agreed date and time.
    

If you wish to make a request for a refund, any such request for refund must be made within 48 hours after the scheduled end time of the Services. For each valid refund request, Loconomics will refund the Payment Amount upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the User Account of the Client with an equivalent value in Loconomics "Credits" for future purchases through the Loconomics Service. Loconomics Credits do not expire.

Loconomics reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (a) place on hold all or a portion of any Payment Amount, or (b) refund the Payment Amount, provide Credits, or arrange for the PSP to provide a refund.

Service Professionals may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP, and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between Service Professionals and the PSP retained by Loconomics are available by clicking [here](https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/payment-services-agreement) (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Service, each Service Professional agrees that they have opened, downloaded, or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that Loconomics is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP, and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that Loconomics has no obligations or liability to any Service Professional under the PSP Agreement.

Users of the Loconomics Service will be liable for any taxes required to be paid on the Services provided under the Agreement.

Because state and local tax laws vary significantly by locality, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting requirements in consultation with tax advisors, and that Loconomics cannot and does not offer tax advice to Service Professionals or Clients. You have to pay your taxes for any income you receive in transactions resulting from using Loconomics. We are not liable for your nonpayment of taxes.

Upon termination, we will have no further obligation to grant you any access to or use of the Loconomics Service.

## 15. Special Promotions

We may from time to time provide certain promotional opportunities to Users. All promotions will be run at our sole discretion, and can be activated, modified or removed at any time by us without advance notification.

In the event that you are given a code through which you may refer a friend to Loconomics in exchange for a referral credit, you shall not use any online marketing or advertising to promote such code or to artificially increase the amount of credits awarded. By way of example, you may not post, or cause, request, or permit a third party to post any such code on a coupon website, nor use any paid search marketing, online advertising, forum posting, newsgroup posting, or bulk email to disseminate such code. You may only share such code with your personal friends and acquaintances for legitimate referral purposes, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Without limiting our other rights and remedies, we may terminate such code and/or your account for any breach of this Section.

## 16. Third Party Resources

The Loconomics Service may give you access to links to third-party websites. We provide such third party links to help you find potentially relevant resources, but we do not endorse any of these third party sites or services and we do not control them in any manner. Accordingly, the Company does not assume any liability associated with the third party service. You need to take appropriate steps to determine whether accessing a third party service is appropriate using your own discretion, and to protect your personal information and privacy on such third party site or service.

## 17. Disputes

If you have a dispute with another User, you should make every attempt to resolve your dispute in direct conversation with the other User, preferably using the Loconomics messaging service. Should Users be unable to reach a resolution in a dispute about Services, Payment Amount, or a User Review, Loconomics will make the final decision.

You release Loconomics (and its officers, directors, members, owners, employees, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in their favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected their settlement with the debtor."

If you have a complaint about the Loconomics Service, you may direct complaints to:

We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with Loconomics. If those efforts fail, by using the Loconomics Service you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against Loconomics arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, the Loconomics Service, or the purchase or sale of any Services, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures"). You agree further that:

-   a) The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Loconomics;
    
-   b) The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
    
-   c) There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or Loconomics' individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
    
-   d) In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Loconomics will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and
    
-   e) With the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Loconomics shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
    

## 19. Background Checks and License Verification

Service Professionals may choose, and in some cases are required, to undergo Background Checks or License Verification. These Background Checks and License Verifications are carried out in accordance with the “ [Background Check and License Verification Policy](https://localdev.loconomics.com.au/terms/background-check-policy),” which is available HERE and incorporated into this Policy by reference.

NEITHER LOCONOMICS NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY SERVICE PROFESSIONALS IN CONNECTION WITH CLIENTS' USE OF THE BACKGROUND CHECKS, TIER RESULTS, OR OTHER SUMMARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING MISUSE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESULTS BY CLIENTS. NEITHER LOCONOMICS NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY SERVICE PROFESSIONALS IN CONNECTION WITH LOCONOMICS' DETERMINATION OF TIER RANKING OR PUBLICATION OF A SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND CHECK OR LICENSE VERIFICATION INFORMATION. NEITHER LOCONOMICS NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY CLIENT RESULTING FROM INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE BACKGROUND CHECKS OR LICENSE VERIFICATION, MISREPORTED TIER RESULTS, OR ANY OTHER INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE SUMMARY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CLIENT OR TO THE PUBLIC.
